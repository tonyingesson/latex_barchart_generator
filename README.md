### LaTeX files for multicolored bar charts This repository contains LaTeX
files that can be used to generate multicolored bar charts for use in
presentations, etc. Simply replace the labels and numbers in the files as you
see fit, then compile in LaTeX, and you'll get a PDF file from which you can
copy and paste your chart. Already included in the repository are bar charts
for a few Swedish elections (1973, 1985, 1994, 2006) and prognoses for the 2014
election.
